## ðŸ’¡ Quick Tips

### For Best Results:
- **Answer thoroughly**: More detailed answers get higher scores
- **Watch the timer**: It auto-submits when time runs out
- **Easy questions**: 20 seconds - quick answers okay
- **Medium questions**: 60 seconds - explain with examples
- **Hard questions**: 120 seconds - architectural thinking required

### Interview Score Guide:
- **80-100**: Excellent - Strong hire
- **60-79**: Good - Consider for interview
- **40-59**: Average - Needs improvement
- **0-39**: Poor - Not recommended

### Sample Good Answers:

**Easy Question**: "What is the difference between var, let, and const?"
```
var is function-scoped and can be redeclared. let is block-scoped 
and can be reassigned but not redeclared. const is also block-scoped 
but cannot be reassigned or redeclared. Modern best practice is to 
use const by default, let when reassignment is needed, and avoid var.
```

**Medium Question**: "Explain React hooks like useState and useEffect"
```
useState is a hook that allows functional components to have state. 
It returns an array with the current state value and a setter function. 
useEffect is used for side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, 
or manual DOM changes. It runs after render and can clean up with a 
return function. Both hooks must be called at the top level of 
components and follow the Rules of Hooks.
```

**Hard Question**: "Design a REST API for an e-commerce platform"
```
I would structure the API with these main resources:
- /api/products (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for product catalog
- /api/users (POST for registration, PUT for updates)
- /api/auth (POST for login/logout, JWT tokens)
- /api/cart (GET, POST, DELETE) for shopping cart
- /api/orders (GET, POST) for order processing
- /api/payments (POST) for payment processing

Use proper HTTP methods, status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 500).
Implement pagination for lists, authentication with JWT, rate limiting
for security, and versioning (/api/v1/). Use HTTPS in production,
validate all inputs, and implement proper error handling with 
consistent error response format.
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Resume not parsing?
- Make sure it's a PDF or DOCX
- Check that text is selectable (not an image)
- Try a simpler formatted resume

### Timer not working?
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled

### Data not saving?
- Check if localStorage is enabled
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Check if in private/incognito mode (some browsers restrict storage)

### Can't see candidates in dashboard?
- Make sure you completed the interview (all 6 questions)
- Check that you're on the "Interviewer" tab
- Try refreshing the page

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

Common issues and solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| NPM install fails | Delete node_modules and package-lock.json, try again |
| Port 3000 in use | Stop other apps or use PORT=3001 npm start |
| Build fails | Check Node version (need 14+) |
