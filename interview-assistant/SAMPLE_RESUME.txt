## How to Use These Samples

1. Copy the text above into a text editor
2. Save as .txt first
3. Use online converters or Word to create PDF/DOCX:
   - For PDF: Use "Print to PDF" or online converter
   - For DOCX: Paste into Microsoft Word and save

4. Test scenarios:
   - Sample 1: All fields present → Should start immediately
   - Sample 2: Missing phone → Should ask for phone
   - Sample 3: Missing email → Should ask for email
   - Sample 4: Missing name → Should ask for name

5. For testing multiple missing fields:
   - Create a resume with just a phone number
   - System should collect name and email via chat

## Tips for Creating Test Resumes

1. **Keep formatting simple**: Plain text works best for parsing
2. **Include clear labels**: "Email:", "Phone:", etc.
3. **Use standard formats**:
   - Email: name@domain.com
   - Phone: (123) 456-7890 or +1-123-456-7890
4. **Put name at the top**: First line is usually detected as name
5. **Avoid images**: Parser only extracts text
